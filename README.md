# Java-Calculator
Object Orientated Programming and Java - Defining classes, instantiating objects of those classes and calling methods on those objects

Java Calculator
In this exercise you will have to program a Java application that performs calculations (addition and multiplication). The application will consist of two classes:

• A class Calculator that has two instance variables and three methods:

– setNumbers(int x,int y) - which is used to set the numbers
– addNumbers() - which is used to return the sum of the numbers – multiplyNumbers() - which is used to multiply the numbers

• a class CalculatorApp that contains the main method and asks the user what he/she wants to do through a menu. Depending what the user wants to do, it needs to call the appropriate methods in the class Calculator and potentially print the results returned.

Example of program behaviour:

Please choose one of the following options:
[1] - Set numbers
[2] - Add Numbers
[3] - Multiply numbers
The user will type 1,2 or 3 and depending on what the user types the program should behave accordingly.

Remember that you have to type each class in a separate .java file and compile both. You will then run the application with: java CalculaterApp
